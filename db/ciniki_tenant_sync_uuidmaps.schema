# Description
# -----------
# This table stores the uuid maps between instances.  This was initially designed 
# to store the user uuid maps between systems.  Users should be able to be mapped
# by their email address, but won't officially until added into this table.
#
# When a user is created in the remote system as an employee, they will be added
# to the local system with the same uuid.  The owner who sets up the sync, will 
# have to already exist on either instance, but will different UUID's.  This table
# will provide the mappings between instance UUID's.
# 
# Fields
# ------
# sync_id:              The ID of the syncronization the uuidmap is for.
#
# table_name:           The table name for the uuid map.
#
# remote_uuid:          The remote uuid which will be changed to the local_uuid when inserting.
#
# local_id:             The local_id which should be substituted for the remote_uuid when
#                       inserted into this server.
