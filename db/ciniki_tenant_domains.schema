#
# Description
# -----------
# The ciniki_tenant_domains stores the fully qualified domains registered to a tenant.
# Multiple domains can be registered to the same tenant.
#
# *note* Currently only one domain is allowed per tenant.
#
# Fields
# ------
# id:               The database id of the domain.
# tnid:             The tenant the domain is part of.
# domain:           The domain name OR the sitename.  The type determines how the
#                   domain is used when looking up websites. 
#
#                   This field is not unique in the database, as a domain could
#                   have a status deleted with one tenant and active with another.
#
#                   The domain must be unique within the database, because it is used to lookup a tenant.
#
# flags:            
#                   0x01 - The domain is a fully qualified domain.
#                   0x02 - Designate this site as primary *future*
#                   0x04 - The domain is registed here *future*
#                   0x08 - subdomain (this domain is a subdomain of another *future*)
#                   0x10 - Force SSL for this domain
#                   0x20 - 
#                   0x40 - 
#                   0x80 - 
#
# status:           The current status of the domain.
#                   0 - unknown
#                   1 - active
#                   10 - api only, no web hosting *future*
#                   20 - expired
#                   50 - suspended
#                   60 - deleted
#
# root_id:          The parent root domain if not this one.  If this
#                   record is a sub domain, then this points to the
#                   root domain if hosted here. (not used currently)
#
# expiry_date:      The date the domain is set to expire, used for tracking renewals.
#
# managed_by:       Who is managing the registration and DNS.
#
# date_added:       The UTC date and time the domain was added to the table.
# last_updated:     The UTC date and time the domain was last updated.
